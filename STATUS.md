## P5 — who was at work, and what the shop is licensed to do (2026-10-06)

`test/audit/audit.staff.js` — **26/26** — works a full day of attendance and opens the
compliance register for a branch. Attendance **8/8** and compliance **7/7** are now exercised
by a live audit; coverage overall is **134 of 196 routes** (was 119 after P4, 88 before P2).

### One production defect, in `POST /api/attendance/clock-in`

The route registers a first-seen machine as a PENDING device "so the manager can approve it
once instead of every shift" — and the guard that does it compared
`classification.deviceStatus === 'UNREGISTERED'`. **That value does not exist**: the classifier
answers `REGISTERED` / `UNRECOGNIZED` / `NOT_APPLICABLE` (`domain/geofence.js:67`), and the
string `UNREGISTERED` appears nowhere else in the product. The branch was dead code, so:

* the machine that clocked somebody in every day **never appeared on the device list**;
* no manager could ever approve it, because there was nothing to approve;
* on a branch set to REGISTERED_DEVICE mode — where the till itself is the credential — every
  shift from that machine was flagged **for ever**, which is precisely the outcome the comment
  says the code prevents. A flag nobody can clear is a flag everybody learns to ignore.

Found by the audit looking for the pending device it had just clocked in from and finding an
empty list. Fixed to compare against `DEVICE_STATUS.UNRECOGNIZED`, and the audit now proves
both directions: an unknown machine is flagged and listed as PENDING, approving it makes the
next clock-in clean, and a clock-in kilometres away from an *approved* machine is still caught
by the fence.

### What else the two flows prove

* **Attendance:** a fence that cannot be right is refused and moves nothing (`IMPLAUSIBLE_COORDINATES`);
  a clock-in at the shop is recorded, placed (`ON_SITE`, distance inside the fence) and **not
  flagged**; a second clock-in while on shift is refused; the day's board counts who is in,
  who is still in, who is out and **names who is absent**; a STAFF seat cannot review its own
  shift (`ROLE_REQUIRED`), a rejection with no reason is `MISSING_FIELD` and with a two-letter
  one is `REASON_REQUIRED`; an accepted review records **who** and **when** and leaves the flag
  in place (the flag is "something looked odd", the review is "a person looked"); clocking out
  with no open shift is `NOT_CLOCKED_IN`.
* **Compliance:** the checklist names what the vertical requires (ELECTRONICS: eight types) and
  reports the missing ones — `MISSING` is deliberately not a row in the register; a recorded
  licence reads back `EXPIRING` inside the window with its days-to-expiry, and the alert list
  and its `counts` carry the same fact; renewing it moves the register, clears the alert and
  reduces the checklist's missing count **by one**, together; a manager **cannot** file a
  licence against a branch they do not run (and can file one against their own without naming
  it); backwards dates and a second live record of the same type are refused by name; a
  staff member may read the register and not write to it; a mistake can be removed (soft, and
  once); and the expiry notifier raises each alert **once**, not every time it runs.
